### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Hikmet GEZMEN. I am currently residing in Sakarya, Turkey and continuing my undergraduate education in Software Engineering at Manisa Celal Bayar University.

I am interested in technologies like JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDb and REST API. I'm also trying to learn technologies like Java and some React. Thanks to my work experience, I gained familiarity with teamwork and software development processes. I am currently working as a Software Engineer Intern in a software company where I continue to develop and develop my skills.
